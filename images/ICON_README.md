# PWA Icons

You need to create two app icons:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Option 1: Create from your logo/image
Use an image editor or online tool like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Canva.com

## Option 2: Quick placeholder
For now, you can copy one of your product images and rename it to icon-192.png and icon-512.png

## To create proper icons:
1. Extract your Ransam Healthcare logo from the first page image
2. Resize to 192x192 and 512x512
3. Save as PNG with transparent background
4. Place in the /images folder

The icons should be simple, recognizable versions of your brand logo.
